#### The complete algorithm of PCSS

* Blocker search (getting the average blocker depth in a certain region)
* Penumbra estimation (using the average blocker depth to determine the filter size)
* Percentage Closer Filtering

### Variance Soft Shadow Mapping

### Enviornment Mapping

#### Distance Field Soft Shadow

* Distance function: At any point, giving the minimun distance (could be signed distance) to the closest location on an object

**The Usages of Distance Fields**

* Ray marching (Sphere tracing) to perform ray-SDF intersection
* Use SDF to determine the (approx.) percentage of occlusion
